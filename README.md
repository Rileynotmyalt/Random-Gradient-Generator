# Random-Gradient-Generator
Randomizes a gradient based on the previously determined pixels.

# Features:
-range limits (from starting color, and from total RGB values)
-sensitivity adjustment
-alphas that you can crop, resize, and place.
-save RGB channels individually

the randomization is relatively linear, while the RGB values are unpredictable, the pattern is relatively consistent, this will change in other variations.

I am currently experimenting with other forms of pattern generation and gradients. they will be linked here when complete.

# Future Projects:
-Voronoi diagrams (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram)
-Linear gradients with user-defined change functions
-Combining linear gradients
-Angled gradients

my final goal is to combine all of this into one application with an intuitive GUI and easy-to-use basic functions. As well as giving the user control over as much as possible in some sort of advanced mode.
